Hi, I'm Dylan! I recently  recieved my masters in Big Data Analytics from San Deigo State University, focusing on data science and machine learning. I love learning all things data and I like to challenge myself.  I have leadership experience as the lab coordinator for the AI4Busniess Lab and leading the largest research project for the lab (The Ukarine War Stock Prediction Project). I also have teaching experience for 6 different classes, both undergraduate and graduate corses. Im seeking opportunities to apply my machine learning expertise.  I enjoy working with teams to solve complex problems that have an impact on our world.
