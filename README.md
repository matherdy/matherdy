Hi! Im Dylan and I am a graduate student at San Diego State University in the Big Data Analytics Program.
I graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in Statistics and a Minor in Data Science.
I love learning all things code and I like to challenge myself.  
I am currently looking for a part time job or internship to do concurrently with my studies.
